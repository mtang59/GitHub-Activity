  Once upon a time, there was a boy who lived in a house with his relatives that despised him. He was force to live underneath the staircase in the small room where he couldn't even stand up straight. One day, he got a visit from an owl inviting him to join the prestigious Hogwarts school of witchcraft & wizardry. He was skeptical and decided to just go about his normal life. The next day, he got a visit from a professor at the school, who came to personally invite him to the school. He didn't know what to think, but he accepted his offer. That boys name was Harry Potter, and he was about to enter an entire different world.
