  Once upon a time, there was a boy who lived in a house with his relatives that despised him. He was force to live underneath the staircase in the small room where he couldn't even stand up straight. One day, he got a visit from an owl inviting him to join the prestigious Hogwarts school of witchcraft & wizardry. He was skeptical and decided to just go about his normal life. The next day, he got a visit from a professor at the school, who came to personally invite him to the school. He didn't know what to think, but he accepted his offer. That boys name was Harry Potter, and he was about to enter an entire different world.
  
  (Maxwell Kachelek) However, Harry Potter was not a fan of Hogwarts. He didn't like being magical and did not want to fufill this "destiny" that everyone tells him he needs to follow. He just wanted to go home, live under the stairs and be unhappy with his life. Every day, he would get letters from the school asking him to come back and learn magic to save the world from Voldemort but he wanted to team up with him. He wanted to world to be just as unhappy and miserable as he was. 
  
Harry Potter turned to the dark side. One rainy night, Lord Voldemort approached the house he was living at during the summer. Coincidentally, also unfortunately, the family he lived with was not home. Harry Potter accepted Voldemort's offer of eternal life and gave himself back to the Dark Lord.
